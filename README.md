# shamshir

Attach a label to pull requests based on the number of approvals.

## Motivation
- Don't waste time attaching `releasable` labels to pull requests

## Design goals
- Enable to run both on a stand-alone server and on Github Actions platform
- Supposed to run under stricter assessment of pull request approvals (e.g.: Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed)

## Usage

### On a stand-alone server

#### Setup
```
$ npm install
```

#### Run
```
$ export shamshir_pat="<your_personal_access_token>"
$ node shamshir-stand-alone.js --owner <project_name> --repo <project_repository> --label <label_name> --quoram <the_number_of_approvals>
```
Eg:
```
$ node shamshir-stand-alone.js --owner kyagi --repo awesome-project --label releasable --quorum 2
```

#### Log
```
$ cat combined.log

shamshir.yml
```
name: ShamshirLabeling
# *** You can choose events to trigger. ***
on:
  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted, edited, dismissed]
  pull_request:
    types: [edited, labeld, unlabeled]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0,30 0-10 * * 1-5'

jobs:
  Labeling:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "ðŸŒ™ Shamshir was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: npm install
      - id: shamshir-run
        uses: kyagi/shamshir@v1
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          repo:  ${{ github.repository }}
# *** You can choose a label. ***
          label: 'releasable'
# *** You can choose a quorum. ***
          quorum: '2'
      - run: echo "${{ steps.shamshir-run.outputs.log }}"
      - run: echo "ðŸŒ™ Shamshir's status is ${{ job.status }}."
